NAME
    SKOS::Simple - Simple SKOS without package dependencies

DESCRIPTION
    This Perl 5 module provides a class to create and manage SKOS data.

INSTALLATION
    You can get the latest development version from github at
      http://github.com/nichtich/skos-simple. 

    The core of this module is just one file Simple.pm, located in
    lib/SKOS/. Feel free to copy and rename it as you like. For 
    instance if you put Simple.pm in the same directory as your 
    script, you can include it via the following statement:

      require 'Simple.pm';

    To not clutter your system with several copies of the file, you
    should better cleanly install the module. To do so from source:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build test
    $ ./Build install # if you are root

    You can then use SKOS::Simple in your scripts like other modules:

      use SKOS::Simple;
